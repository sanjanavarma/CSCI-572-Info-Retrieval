Search Engine: Bing

The average overlap for all 100 queries is just 1.52, which means that, on average, out of 10 URLs, only atmost 2 of the search results match.
Apart from that, the percentage of overlap is calculated to be just 15.352, as reflected in the average overlap result.
Last but not least, the average Spearman Coefficient is -6.2425. Which means that the corrrelation is very weak between Google and Bing.
This essentially tells us that Bing and Google have different mechanisms for ranking search results.
